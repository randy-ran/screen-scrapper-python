Screen scrapper in python

This code are just for fun, and learn.

I have developed scrapper through PhantomJS as system call.
Jobs are asynchronously processed via celery and stored in redis.

TODO:

optimize images
tornado/webpy microservice for enqueue jobs and retrieve images
drop old images in redis with periodic task in celery
